# Qentem Engine (v0.9.5.1)

## Summary:
Qentem is a stand-alone library built to provide a simple way to match existing syntaxes or new ones. It also provides call-backs for post or per-parsing. Built for templates, then rewritten for general-propose syntax matching.

## Status:
The project is in an early stage of development. However, stability is achieved through extensive tests (3 times the size of the engine).
